# Wind Power Forecasting with Machine Learning (Project03 in 46W38)

This project implements a modular, GUI visualized, reusable Python package for machine-learning forecasting.  
It includes:
* data loading utilities
* multiple machine-learning forecasting models
* plotting functions
* a graphical user interface (GUI)
* a complete example workflow for evaluation  
This project reads the datasets supplied for Project03, processes the time-series data, and provides a GUI-based environment that runs fixed machine learning forecasting models, while keeping the code structure extensible for future model additions.

## Package Overview

The `windpower_forecast` package provides tools for:

### Data Processing

* Time-based splitting of datasets for training and testing in time-series forecasting
* Vectorization of wind direction and generation of time-related features

### Forecasting Models

Implemented inside `models.py`:

* Baseline / naïve model
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Random Forest Regressor
* Other scikit-learn based regressors
* Standardized interface for training & prediction

### ✔ Plotting

Implemented inside `forecaster_plot.py`:

* forecast vs real curves
* multiple-model comparison in a single figure
* configurable titles, legends, and time axes

### ✔ GUI Tool (optional feature)

Implemented in `GUI.py`:

* Tkinter-based front-end
* Choose CSV file from `inputs/`
* Select date ranges
* Select train/test split index
* Train several ML models at once
* Visualize output in matplotlib

## Class Implementations

The project contains multiple classes (requirement satisfied). Key classes include:

---

### `class BaseModelTrainer`

*File:* `models.py`

Defines the standard interface for all forecasting models.

**Main methods**

* `fit(X, y)`
* `predict(X)`
* `evaluate(y_true, y_pred)`

---

### `class SVRForecaster(BaseModel)`

*File:* `models.py`

Implements a Support Vector Regression model for time-series forecasting.

---

### `class RandomForestForecaster(BaseModel)`

*File:* `models.py`

Implements a Random Forest model suitable for nonlinear forecasting.

---

### GUI Class — `class ForecastGUI`

*File:* `GUI.py`

Encapsulates the Tkinter graphical interface.

Features:

* file selector
* date/time range preview
* train/test split
* buttons to train models and visualize results
* auto-plotting of forecast outputs

---

## How to Run (Evaluation Script)

Your evaluation entry point is **main.py** located at project root.

### Run the main example:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script demonstrates:

* loading a CSV dataset
* preparing train/test split
* training one or more forecasting models
* plotting forecast vs real curves
* saving results into `outputs/`

Runtime is well under the required **10 minutes**.
